    <h1>BOSSES</h1>
    <p>Deepwoken features many monsters you can fight for your progression. These may include a Megalodaunt or Stone Knight.</p>
    <div class="images">
        <div class="monsters">
            <h3>Megalodaunt</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="monsters">
            <h3>Stone Knight</h3>
            <img src="./assets/DesertKnight_webp.png" height="300" alt="Stone Knight">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>However, these monsters are considered lowly when compared to the true beasts of the game.</p>
    <h2>DUKE ERISIA</h2>
    <img src="./assets/Theduke_webp.png" alt="Duke">
    <p>The creator of the Golems, Duke Erisia is the main boss you fight against to obtain your Resonance.</p>
    <p>He is a relatively easy boss once you get the hang of him.</p>
    <h2>PRIMADON</h2>
    <img src="./assets/maxresdefault_jpg.png" alt="Primadon">
    <p>A boss favored by many, as he drops the most loot.</p>
    <p>Be warned, however, as he can kill you in just a few hits.</p>
    <p>If you do not beat him within a 16 minute timeframe, he leaves and goes back to the ocean.</p>
    <h2>DREAD SERPENT</h2>
    <img src="./assets/Kaido_webp.png" alt="Kaido">
    <p>This boss is encountered while you boat across the Void Sea.</p>
    <p>If you do encounter them, RUN.</p>
    <p>The Dread Serpent has the highest amount of health in the game and deals the most damage.</p>
    <p>If you are lucky enough to beat the serpent, you will be granted an ability that allows you to deal more damage to other players.</p>
