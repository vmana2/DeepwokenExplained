    <h1>BELLS</h1>
    <h2>What are Bells, or Resonances in Deepwoken?</h2>
    <p>Resonances are one of the many skills that players can obtain. They are the most varied when it comes to all the abilities, and are quite powerful, having effects from perfect invisibility, map-wide teleportation, and instantaneous gripping. </p>
    <p>Resonances are universally represented as an item attached on your waist. This item can be a bell, a chime, jingle bells or a sleigh bell. They can also be of varying colors, ranging from yellow, green, to red, dark blue, black and purple.</p>

    <p>Shard bow allows the user to deal heavy amounts of damage while also distancing themselves from their opponent.</p>
    <h2>What are Corrupted Resonances?</h2>
    <p>If you are lucky enough you will have the chance to roll a Corrupted Resonance.</p>
    <p>Corrupted Resonances feature strong upsides along with major downsides.</p>
    <p>If you were to have a Corrupted Shard Bow, you will have the chance to do more damage and gain more distance.</p>
    <p>However, you may lose some health as a cost.</p>
