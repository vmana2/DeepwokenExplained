    <h1>STATS AND ATTRIBUTES</h1>
    <p>The progression system in Deepwoken allows the stats you invest in determine what kind of talents you get for your character.</p>
    <p>The talents in this game can make or break your build, so be careful.</p>

        <p>Example of Attributes GUI.</p>
        <img src="./assets/Attributes_Chart_2.0_webp.png" alt="Attributes GUI">
    </div>
    <p>For example, if you were to focus your points into Fortitude, you would roll talents that pertain to that category.</p>
    <h2>What makes a strong build?</h2>
    <p>In the current Deepwoken meta, high health builds with huge damage output tend to remain the strongest.</p>
    <p>People usually make these builds with high fortitude and use a heavy weapon.</p>
    <p>This is subject to change though, as the Deepwoken developers make balance changes every week. So be on the lookout!</p>
