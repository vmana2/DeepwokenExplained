    <h1>DEATH</h1>
    <p>Upon dying, your character will be sent to the underworld, otherwise known as the Depths.</p>
    <p>The rule of thumb is that if you die in the Depths, your character will be gone forever.</p>
    <div class="picture">
        <img src="./assets/Depths_City_webp.png" alt="Depths">
    </div>
    <p>This place holds a numerous amounts of monsters outside of the main city in the Depths.</p>
    <p>A monster you want to remain as far as possible from would be the Deep Owl.</p>
    <div class="monsters">
        <img src="./assets/Owlloawdad_webp.png" alt="Owl">
    </div>
    <p>These owls have the highest damage output. You especially do not want to deal with these monsters if they are corrupted.</p>
    <h2>Is there a way I can get out of the Depths?</h2>
    <p>It is possible to leave the Depths, but at a cost.</p>
    <p>You must beat a boss in the castle of the Depths. These bosses could range from an easy enemy to the Enforcer.</p>
    <h2>I died in the Depths. What now?</h2>
    <p>If you die in the Depths, you go to the Fragments of Self.</p>
    <div class="fragments">

    </div>
    <p>Here, you are able to give yourself a number of items for your next journey.</p>
    <p>You converse with your spirit and restart your character back from level 1.</p>
